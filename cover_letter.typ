Dear Hiring Manager,

Iâ€™m excited about the opportunity to apply for the Junior DevOps Engineer position at Nex Digital Studio. With a strong foundation in DevOps practices and hands-on experience gained through both academic projects and a recent internship, I am confident that I can contribute effectively to your team.

During my internship at F1Soft International Pvt. Ltd., I worked extensively with Docker and Kubernetes, deploying containerized applications. My experience with tools like Jenkins, Ansible, and Terraform has given me a solid understanding of Infrastructure as Code and automation processes.

I have attached my resume for your consideration, which further highlights my skills, coursework, and academic projects. I would be delighted to discuss my qualifications further in an interview. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Saurab Tharu
